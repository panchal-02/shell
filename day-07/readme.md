# Week 01 – Bash Fundamentals Integration Script

This script marks the completion of **Week 01** of my Bash scripting learning journey.

The purpose of this script is to **combine core Bash concepts** into a single, structured program, demonstrating how different features work together in real scripts.

## 📌 What This Script Does

The script:
- Accepts multiple command-line arguments
- Uses functions to organize logic
- Evaluates user age using conditional statements
- Performs arithmetic operations on numeric inputs
- Generates a multiplication table using a loop
- Checks for the existence of a directory and file
- Creates the directory and file if they do not exist

## 🛠 Concepts Covered

- Command-line arguments (`$1`, `$#`)
- Functions with parameters
- Conditional logic using `(( ))`
- Arithmetic operations in Bash
- `for` loops
- File and directory existence checks (`-d`, `-f`)
- Safe creation of directories and files
