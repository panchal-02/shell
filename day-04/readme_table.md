# Day 04 – Multiplication Table Using Loops in Bash

This script is part of **Day 03** of my shell scripting learning journey.

The goal of this exercise was to understand how **loops work in Bash** by generating a multiplication table using both `for` and `while` loops.

---

## 📌 What This Script Does

The script:
- Takes a number from the user
- Prints the multiplication table using a `for` loop
- Takes another number from the user
- Prints the multiplication table using a `while` loop
- Demonstrates repeated execution using different loop types
- Uses delays to clearly show execution flow

---

## 🛠 Concepts Covered

- Reading user input using `read -p`
- `for` loop with brace expansion
- `while` loop with conditional checks
- Arithmetic operations using `$(( ))`
- Loop counters and increments
- Script flow control using `sleep`

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Script

Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x table.sh
