# Day 04 – Loops in Bash

This script is part of **Day 03** of my shell scripting learning journey.

The focus of this exercise was to understand how **loops work in Bash** and how different looping methods control repeated execution.

---

## 📌 What This Script Does

The script:
- Takes a user’s name as input
- Demonstrates looping using:
  - `for` loop (C-style)
  - `for` loop (brace expansion)
  - `while` loop
- Prints numbers in sequence using different loop techniques
- Adds delays to clearly observe execution flow

---

## 🛠 Concepts Covered

- Reading user input using `read -p`
- C-style `for` loop (`for (( ; ; ))`)
- Range-based `for` loop (`{start..end}`)
- `while` loop with condition checks
- Loop counters and increments
- Script flow control using `sleep`

## ▶️ How to Run the Script

Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x loop.sh
