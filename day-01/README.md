# Day 01 – Interactive Bash Script

This script is part of **Day 01** of my shell scripting learning journey.

The goal of this exercise was to understand how **basic Bash scripts interact with users**, handle input, and execute commands sequentially.

---

##  What This Script Does

The script:
- Asks the user for their name
- Greets the user personally
- Asks about the user’s mood
- Asks what the user plans to do today
- Responds based on the provided inputs
- Uses delays to demonstrate execution flow

---

##  Concepts Covered

- User input using `read`
- Output using `echo`
- Variables in Bash
- Sequential execution
- Adding delays with `sleep`
- Basic script structure with a shebang (`#!/bin/bash`)

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Script

Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x hello.sh

## Run it
  ./hello.sh
