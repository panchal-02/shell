# Day 01 – Shell Scripting Basics

This is **Day 01** of my shell scripting learning journey.

On this day, I created my **first interactive Bash script** to understand how basic shell programs work with user input and execution flow.

## 📌 What This Script Covers

- Taking user input using `read`
- Storing input in variables
- Printing output using `echo`
- Adding execution delays with `sleep`
- Understanding basic script flow

## 🛠 Script Overview

The script:
1. Asks the user for their name
2. Interacts with the user through simple questions
3. Responds based on the provided input
4. Demonstrates sequential execution in Bash

This script is intentionally simple to focus on **fundamentals**, not complexity.
